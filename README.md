# Customer Segmentation and Market Analysis using KPMG's Virtual Internship Data

### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer data provided by KPMG during their virtual internship program. The primary objectives include segmenting customers based on their behaviour and characteristics, conducting a market analysis to identify opportunities, and providing actionable insights for marketing and product strategies. The project will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation using clustering algorithms, and the creation of vizualizations to present the findings. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the application of data analytics techniques in understanding customer behaviour and making strategic business recommendations. 

### Data Sources
